## Installation
Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage):

1. Create a cartfile with following content within your project directory: `github "mollywoodnini/ImageViewer"`
2. run `carthage update`. Carthage builds the ImageViewer framework, which you'll have to import to your project.
3. On your application targets’ “General” settings tab, in the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section, drag and drop both frameworks from the Carthage/Build folder on disk.
4. On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script with the following contents:
```
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```
and add the paths to the frameworks under “Input Files”:
```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/ImageViewer.framework
```

## Usage
Just create an ImageView and prepare it for the ImageViewer via:
```swift
imageView.setupForImageViewer()
```

You can specify the background color of the ImageViewer too:
```swift
imageView.setupForImageViewer(UIColor.redColor())
```

To hide the status bar add the "View controller-based status bar appearance" key to the Info.plist and set its value to NO.
